# agentsDartsV3.3

This zip contains **copy/paste Agent Mode prompts** that correspond 1:1 with the phases in `planDartsV3.3.zip`.

## How to use

1. Open `planDartsV3.3/README.md` and pick the phase you are running.
2. Copy the matching agent prompt from this folder.
3. Run **one phase per session**. Do not continue into the next phase.

## Ground rules (apply to every agent)

- Use the repo zip provided by the user as input.
- Only modify files explicitly allowed for the phase.
- Do not invent file paths; first inspect the repo tree.
- Run the phase gate commands and stop.
- Output full contents of every changed/created file.
- Produce a new repo zip named per the phase instructions.
